# Implementation Review Pattern

## Pattern Purpose and Context

This pattern provides a structured approach for reviewing completed implementations, gathering lessons learned, and identifying improvements for future projects. It ensures teams capture valuable insights from both successful and challenging implementations while building institutional knowledge.

## When to Use This Pattern

- **Post-Launch Reviews**: After deploying major features or products to production
- **Project Completion**: When finishing significant projects or milestones
- **Incident Response**: After resolving major production issues or outages
- **Process Changes**: After implementing new tools, methodologies, or workflows
- **Team Changes**: When team composition or structure changes significantly

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Preparation (1 week before review)
1. **Define Review Scope**
   - Identify what will be reviewed (specific feature, project, or time period)
   - Determine participants and their roles in the review
   - Set objectives for what the team hopes to learn
   - Gather relevant metrics and performance data

2. **Prepare Review Materials**
   - Collect project documentation and timelines
   - Gather performance metrics and user feedback
   - Prepare prompts and discussion guides
   - Schedule session and invite participants

### Phase 2: Review Session (2-3 hours)
3. **Structured Discussion**
   - Review what went well and why
   - Discuss what could have gone better
   - Identify specific lessons learned
   - Brainstorm improvements for next time

4. **Action Planning**
   - Prioritize identified improvements
   - Assign ownership for follow-up actions
   - Set timelines for implementing changes
   - Define success criteria for improvements

## Success Criteria

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All aspects of implementation are thoroughly reviewed
- **Honest Assessment**: Team provides candid feedback without fear of reprisal
- **Actionable Insights**: Review produces specific, implementable improvements
- **Knowledge Capture**: Lessons learned are documented for future reference
- **Follow-through**: Identified improvements are actually implemented

## Integration with Other Patterns

- **Use with Communication Patterns**: Present review findings to broader stakeholders
- **Combine with Decision-Making Patterns**: Use insights for future project planning
- **Apply with Continuous Improvement Patterns**: Feed learnings into ongoing improvement cycles
