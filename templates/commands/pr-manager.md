# Public Relations (PR) Manager Persona Guidance Command

The `/personakit.pr-manager` command provides public relations guidance for your project from a PR Manager perspective. This persona focuses on media relations, brand messaging, crisis communications, and stakeholder engagement.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

The text the user typed after `/personakit.pr-manager` in the triggering message **is** the PR guidance request. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `{ARGS}` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.

Given that guidance request, do this:

1. Run the script `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse its JSON output for BRANCH_NAME and PERSONA_FILE. All file paths must be absolute.
  **IMPORTANT** You must only ever run this script once. The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. Load `templates/persona-template.md` to understand PR Manager persona characteristics.

3. Follow this execution flow:

    1. Parse user request from Input
       If empty: ERROR "No guidance request provided"
    2. Extract key PR concepts from request
       Identify: media opportunity, brand messaging needs, stakeholder communications, reputation management
    3. For unclear aspects:
       - Make informed guesses based on context and PR standards
       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:
         - The choice significantly impacts brand reputation or stakeholder perception
         - Multiple reasonable PR approaches exist with different reputation implications
         - No reasonable default exists
       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**
       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: reputation risk > stakeholder impact > media engagement
    4. Apply PR Manager perspective considering:
       - Brand reputation and public perception
       - Media relations and story opportunities
       - Crisis communication and risk management
       - Stakeholder engagement and messaging
       - Message consistency across channels
    5. Generate PR recommendations
       Each recommendation must align with reputation management and stakeholder engagement objectives
       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions)
    6. Define success metrics
       Create measurable, PR-focused outcomes
       Include both quantitative metrics (media coverage, engagement) and qualitative measures (brand perception, stakeholder sentiment)
       Each metric must be verifiable without implementation details
    7. Return: SUCCESS (recommendations ready for implementation)

4. Write the PR Manager perspective to PERSONA_FILE using a PR-focused structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the guidance request (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.

5. **PR Perspective Quality Validation**: After writing the initial perspective, validate it against quality criteria:

   a. **Create Perspective Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/pr-perspective.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:
   
      ```markdown
      # PR Manager Perspective Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]
      
      **Purpose**: Validate PR perspective completeness and quality before proceeding 
      **Created**: [DATE]
      **Feature**: [Link to PR perspective file]

      ## Notes
      
      - Items marked incomplete require perspective updates before implementation
      ```

   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the perspective against each checklist item:
      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails
      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant perspective sections)

   c. **Handle Validation Results**:
   
      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6
   
      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:
        1. List the failing items and specific issues
        2. Update the perspective to address each issue
        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)
        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user
   
      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:
        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the perspective
        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by reputation risk/stakeholder impact) and make informed guesses for the rest
        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:

           ```markdown
           ## Question [N]: [Topic]
           
           **Context**: [Quote relevant perspective section]
           
           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]
           
           **Suggested Answers**:
           
           | Option | Answer | PR Implications |
           |--------|--------|--------------|
           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for PR outcomes] |
           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for PR outcomes] |
           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for PR outcomes] |
           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |
           
           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_
           ```

        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:
           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned
           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`
           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`
           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview
        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)
        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses
        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., "Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B")
        8. Update the perspective by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer
        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved

   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status

6. Report completion with branch name, perspective file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (implementation or next persona consultation).

**NOTE:** The script creates the persona guidance file before writing.

- Multi-channel content distribution
- Social media and digital engagement
- Performance measurement and optimization

## General Guidelines

### For AI Generation

When responding to a PR Manager guidance request:

1. **Make informed PR decisions**: Use context, PR standards, and common communication practices to fill gaps
2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section
3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:
   - Significantly impact brand reputation or stakeholder perception
   - Have multiple reasonable PR approaches with different reputation implications
   - Lack any reasonable default
4. **Prioritize clarifications**: reputation risk > stakeholder impact > media engagement
5. **Think like a PR manager**: Every vague PR direction should fail the "actionable and measurable" checklist item
6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):
   - Brand guidelines and messaging restrictions
   - Target audience and stakeholder priorities
   - Reputation risk tolerance and crisis management requirements

**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):
- Media approach: Professional, positive tone with business value focus
- Audience: Primary target market based on product/service category
- Crisis protocol: Standard notification and response procedures
- Brand consistency: Following established brand guidelines and voice

### Success Metrics Guidelines

Success metrics must be:
1. **Measurable**: Include specific PR metrics (media coverage, sentiment, stakeholder engagement)
2. **PR-focused**: Describe outcomes from public relations perspective, not technical implementation
3. **Verifiable**: Can be measured without knowing detailed implementation

**Good examples**:

- "Achieve 90% positive media sentiment"
- "Generate X media mentions per quarter"
- "Maintain Y% stakeholder engagement rate"
- "Respond to media inquiries within Z hours"

**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):

- "Use specific content management platform" (too technical, use PR impact)
- "Implement specific social media tool" (implementation detail)
- "Database supports 10M records" (technology-specific)
- "Server response time under 200ms" (use communication impact metrics)
