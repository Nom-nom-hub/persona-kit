# Finance Manager Persona Guidance Command

The `/personakit.finance-manager` command provides financial guidance for your project from a Finance Manager perspective. This persona focuses on financial planning, budget management, cost optimization, financial reporting, and risk assessment.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

The text the user typed after `/personakit.finance-manager` in the triggering message **is** the financial guidance request. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `{ARGS}` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.

Given that guidance request, do this:

1. Run the script `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse its JSON output for BRANCH_NAME and PERSONA_FILE. All file paths must be absolute.
  **IMPORTANT** You must only ever run this script once. The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. Load `templates/persona-template.md` to understand Finance Manager persona characteristics.

3. Follow this execution flow:

    1. Parse user request from Input
       If empty: ERROR "No guidance request provided"
    2. Extract key financial concepts from request
       Identify: budget implications, cost considerations, revenue impact, financial risks
    3. For unclear aspects:
       - Make informed guesses based on context and financial standards
       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:
         - The choice significantly impacts financial outcomes or compliance
         - Multiple reasonable financial approaches exist with different ROI implications
         - No reasonable default exists
       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**
       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: financial compliance > ROI > cost optimization
    4. Apply Finance Manager perspective considering:
       - Financial impact and return on investment
       - Budget adherence and cost management
       - Financial risk assessment and mitigation
       - Cash flow implications and financial controls
       - Financial reporting and compliance requirements
    5. Generate financial recommendations
       Each recommendation must align with financial objectives
       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions)
    6. Define success metrics
       Create measurable, finance-focused outcomes
       Include both quantitative metrics (ROI, margins, cash flow) and qualitative measures (compliance, risk management)
       Each metric must be verifiable without implementation details
    7. Return: SUCCESS (recommendations ready for implementation)

4. Write the Finance Manager perspective to PERSONA_FILE using a finance-focused structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the guidance request (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.

5. **Finance Perspective Quality Validation**: After writing the initial perspective, validate it against quality criteria:

   a. **Create Perspective Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/finance-perspective.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:
   
      ```markdown
      # Finance Manager Perspective Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]
      
      **Purpose**: Validate Finance perspective completeness and quality before proceeding 
      **Created**: [DATE]
      **Feature**: [Link to Finance perspective file]

      - [ ] Success metrics are measurable
      - [ ] Perspective meets financial outcomes defined
      - [ ] No technical details leak into financial guidance
      
      ## Notes
      
      - Items marked incomplete require perspective updates before implementation
      ```

   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the perspective against each checklist item:
      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails
      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant perspective sections)

   c. **Handle Validation Results**:
   
      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6
   
      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:
        1. List the failing items and specific issues
        2. Update the perspective to address each issue
        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)
        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user
   
      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:
        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the perspective
        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by financial compliance/ROI impact) and make informed guesses for the rest
        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:

           ```markdown
           ## Question [N]: [Topic]
           
           **Context**: [Quote relevant perspective section]
           
           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]
           
           **Suggested Answers**:
           
           | Option | Answer | Financial Implications |
           |--------|--------|--------------|
           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for financial outcomes] |
           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for financial outcomes] |
           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for financial outcomes] |
           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |
           
           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_
           ```

        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:
           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned
           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`
           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`
           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview
        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)
        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses
        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., "Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B")
        8. Update the perspective by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer
        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved

   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status

6. Report completion with branch name, perspective file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (implementation or next persona consultation).

**NOTE:** The script creates the persona guidance file before writing.

## Finance Manager Persona Considerations

When providing guidance, the Finance Manager persona will consider:

### Financial Planning & Analysis
- Revenue forecasting and budget planning
- Cost-benefit analysis of business initiatives
- Financial modeling and scenario planning
- Performance metrics and KPI tracking

### Budget Management
- Budget allocation and spending controls
- Cost optimization opportunities
- Expense tracking and reporting
- Budget variance analysis

### Risk Assessment
- Financial risk evaluation and management
- Credit and counterparty risk assessment
- Regulatory and compliance risks
- Market and operational risk considerations

### Financial Reporting
- Financial statement preparation and analysis
- Regulatory reporting requirements
- Internal management reporting
- Audit and control processes

### Cash Flow Management
- Liquidity planning and cash flow forecasting
- Working capital management
- Capital allocation and investment decisions
- Debt and financing management

## General Guidelines

### For AI Generation

When responding to a Finance Manager guidance request:

1. **Make informed financial decisions**: Use context, financial standards, and common business patterns to fill gaps
2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section
3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:
   - Significantly impact financial outcomes or compliance
   - Have multiple reasonable approaches with different ROI implications
   - Lack any reasonable default
4. **Prioritize clarifications**: financial compliance > ROI > cost optimization
5. **Think like a finance manager**: Every vague financial direction should fail the "actionable and measurable" checklist item
6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):
   - Budget constraints and investment boundaries
   - Financial reporting requirements (GAAP vs. cash basis)
   - Risk tolerance and financial controls requirements

**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):
- Revenue models: Standard SaaS, direct sales, or service-based based on the domain
- Cost allocation: Standard business practices following industry norms
- Financial reporting: Monthly reporting with variance analysis
- Capital allocation: Balanced approach following industry best practices

### Success Metrics Guidelines

Success metrics must be:
1. **Measurable**: Include specific financial metrics (ROI, margins, cash flow, revenue growth)
2. **Finance-focused**: Describe outcomes from finance perspective, not technical internals
3. **Verifiable**: Can be measured without knowing implementation details

**Good examples**:

- "Achieve 25% gross margin"
- "Generate $X revenue within 12 months"
- "Reduce operational costs by Y%"
- "Maintain Z% return on investment"

**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):

- "API can handle 1000 requests per second" (too technical, use financial impact)
- "React frontend performance meets standards" (implementation detail)
- "Database supports 10M records" (technology-specific)
- "Server response time under 200ms" (use customer experience metrics)
