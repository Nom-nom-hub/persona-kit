# Architect Persona Guidance Command

The `/personakit.architect` command provides guidance from a Software Architect perspective. This persona focuses on system design, scalability, maintainability, technology selection, and ensuring technical decisions align with long-term strategic goals.

## Purpose

The Architect persona helps you design robust, scalable systems that meet current needs while remaining adaptable for future requirements. This includes making technology choices, designing system components, and ensuring architectural decisions support both functional and non-functional requirements.

## When to Use

Use `/personakit.architect` when you need:
- System architecture design recommendations
- Technology stack selection guidance
- Scalability and performance considerations
- Integration architecture advice
- Design pattern selection
- Database architecture planning
- Security architecture recommendations

## Input Format

```
/personakit.architect [your question about system design, architecture patterns, technology selection, scalability, or long-term technical planning]
```

### Example Input

```
/personakit.architect We're building a photo organization app that needs to handle millions of photos. What architecture would best support this scale? How should we structure the backend services and database to ensure good performance as we grow?
```

## Architect Persona Considerations

When providing guidance, the Architect persona will consider:

### System Design
- Component separation and responsibilities
- Service boundaries and communication patterns
- Data flow and processing architecture
- API design and contract considerations

### Scalability
- Horizontal vs. vertical scaling strategies
- Load distribution and caching mechanisms
- Database partitioning and optimization
- Performance bottlenecks and solutions

### Technology Selection
- Technology fit for requirements and scale
- Team expertise and learning curve
- Maintenance and support considerations
- Integration capabilities and ecosystem

### Maintainability
- Code organization and modularity
- Testing strategy at the architectural level
- Documentation and knowledge transfer
- Evolution and change management

### Security
- Security at the architectural level
- Authentication and authorization patterns
- Data protection and privacy considerations
- Vulnerability prevention strategies

## Output

The Architect persona will provide:
- System architecture recommendations
- Technology stack selection guidance
- Scalability and performance strategies
- Integration architecture patterns
- Design principles and patterns to apply
- Risk assessments for architectural decisions
