# Sales Manager Persona Guidance Command

The `/personakit.sales-manager` command provides sales guidance for your project from a Sales Manager perspective. This persona focuses on revenue generation, customer acquisition, pipeline management, sales strategies, and team performance optimization.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

The text the user typed after `/personakit.sales-manager` in the triggering message **is** the sales guidance request. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `{ARGS}` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.

Given that guidance request, do this:

1. Run the script `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse its JSON output for BRANCH_NAME and PERSONA_FILE. All file paths must be absolute.
  **IMPORTANT** You must only ever run this script once. The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. Load `templates/persona-template.md` to understand Sales Manager persona characteristics.

3. Follow this execution flow:

    1. Parse user request from Input
       If empty: ERROR "No guidance request provided"
    2. Extract key sales concepts from request
       Identify: revenue goals, customer acquisition needs, pipeline challenges, sales process improvements
    3. For unclear aspects:
       - Make informed guesses based on context and sales standards
       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:
         - The choice significantly impacts revenue outcomes or sales process
         - Multiple reasonable sales approaches exist with different revenue implications
         - No reasonable default exists
       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**
       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: revenue impact > sales cycle > pipeline efficiency
    4. Apply Sales Manager perspective considering:
       - Revenue generation and quarterly targets
       - Customer acquisition and sales pipeline health
       - Sales process optimization and team performance
       - Competitive positioning and customer value proposition
       - Deal closure strategies and negotiation tactics
    5. Generate sales recommendations
       Each recommendation must align with revenue objectives
       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions)
    6. Define success metrics
       Create measurable, sales-focused outcomes
       Include both quantitative metrics (revenue, conversion rates, deal size) and qualitative measures (pipeline quality, customer satisfaction)
       Each metric must be verifiable without implementation details
    7. Return: SUCCESS (recommendations ready for implementation)

4. Write the Sales Manager perspective to PERSONA_FILE using a sales-focused structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the guidance request (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.

5. **Sales Perspective Quality Validation**: After writing the initial perspective, validate it against quality criteria:

   a. **Create Perspective Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/sales-perspective.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:
   
      ```markdown
      # Sales Manager Perspective Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]
      
      **Purpose**: Validate Sales perspective completeness and quality before proceeding 
      **Created**: [DATE]
      **Feature**: [Link to Sales perspective file]

      ## Notes
      
      - Items marked incomplete require perspective updates before implementation
      ```

   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the perspective against each checklist item:
      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails
      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant perspective sections)

   c. **Handle Validation Results**:
   
      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6
   
      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:
        1. List the failing items and specific issues
        2. Update the perspective to address each issue
        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)
        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user
   
      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:
        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the perspective
        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by revenue/sales cycle impact) and make informed guesses for the rest
        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:

           ```markdown
           ## Question [N]: [Topic]
           
           **Context**: [Quote relevant perspective section]
           
           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]
           
           **Suggested Answers**:
           
           | Option | Answer | Sales Implications |
           |--------|--------|--------------|
           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for sales outcomes] |
           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for sales outcomes] |
           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for sales outcomes] |
           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |
           
           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_
           ```

        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:
           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned
           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`
           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`
           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview
        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)
        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses
        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., "Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B")
        8. Update the perspective by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer
        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved

   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status

6. Report completion with branch name, perspective file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (implementation or next persona consultation).

**NOTE:** The script creates the persona guidance file before writing.

## Sales Manager Persona Considerations

When providing guidance, the Sales Manager persona will consider:

### Revenue Generation
- Quarterly and annual revenue targets
- Revenue forecasting and pipeline coverage
- Deal velocity and conversion optimization
- Revenue per customer segment

### Customer Acquisition
- Lead quality and handoff from marketing
- Target customer profiles and segmentation
- Customer pain points and value proposition
- Sales cycle length optimization

### Pipeline Management
- Pipeline health and stage progression
- Forecasting accuracy and deal probability
- Capacity planning and resource allocation
- Pipeline coverage ratios

### Sales Process
- Sales methodology and best practices
- Sales plays and competitive positioning
- Negotiation strategies and objection handling
- Sales tools and CRM effectiveness

### Team Performance
- Individual sales rep performance
- Team coaching and development needs
- Quota attainment and compensation planning
- Sales productivity metrics

## General Guidelines

### For AI Generation

When responding to a Sales Manager guidance request:

1. **Make informed sales decisions**: Use context, sales standards, and common sales patterns to fill gaps
2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section
3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:
   - Significantly impact revenue outcomes or sales process
   - Have multiple reasonable approaches with different revenue implications
   - Lack any reasonable default
4. **Prioritize clarifications**: revenue impact > sales cycle > pipeline efficiency
5. **Think like a sales manager**: Every vague sales direction should fail the "actionable and measurable" checklist item
6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):
   - Revenue targets and investment boundaries
   - Customer segments and sales approach (direct vs. channel)
   - Sales cycle timeline and customer decision process

**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):
- Revenue models: Standard SaaS, direct sales, or channel-based based on the domain
- Customer segments: Based on product category and typical target market
- Sales cycle: Industry standard based on product complexity and customer type
- Quota structure: Balanced approach following industry best practices

### Success Metrics Guidelines

Success metrics must be:
1. **Measurable**: Include specific sales metrics (revenue, conversion rates, deal size, pipeline coverage)
2. **Sales-focused**: Describe outcomes from sales perspective, not technical internals
3. **Verifiable**: Can be measured without knowing implementation details

**Good examples**:

- "Achieve $X million in quarterly revenue"
- "Maintain 3x pipeline coverage for revenue targets"
- "Reduce sales cycle length from X to Y days"
- "Improve lead-to-customer conversion rate from X% to Y%"

**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):

- "API can handle 1000 requests per second" (too technical, use sales impact)
- "React frontend performance meets standards" (implementation detail)
- "Database supports 10M records" (technology-specific)
- "Server response time under 200ms" (use customer experience metrics)
