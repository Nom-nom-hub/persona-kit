- Deployment strategy recommendations
- Infrastructure setup and management
- CI/CD pipeline design and implementation
- Monitoring and observability approaches
- Scalability and performance optimization
- Containerization and orchestration advice
- Operational best practices

## Input Format

```
/personakit.devops [your question about deployment, infrastructure, CI/CD, monitoring, or operational practices]
```

### Example Input

```
/personakit.devops We're building a photo organization app and need to set up our deployment pipeline. What CI/CD approach should we use? How should we handle different environments (development, staging, production)? What infrastructure do we need for hosting?
