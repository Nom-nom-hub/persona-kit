# Developer Persona Guidance Command

The `/personakit.developer` command provides guidance from a Senior Developer perspective. This persona focuses on hands-on implementation details, coding best practices, debugging strategies, and practical development approaches to specific technical challenges.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

The text the user typed after `/personakit.developer` in the triggering message **is** the development guidance request. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `{ARGS}` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.

Given that guidance request, do this:

1. Run the script `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse its JSON output for BRANCH_NAME and PERSONA_FILE. All file paths must be absolute.
  **IMPORTANT** You must only ever run this script once. The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. Load `templates/persona-template.md` to understand Developer persona characteristics.

3. Follow this execution flow:

    1. Parse user request from Input
       If empty: ERROR "No guidance request provided"
    2. Extract key development concepts from request
       Identify: implementation challenges, coding patterns, debugging issues, technology concerns
    3. For unclear aspects:
       - Make informed guesses based on context and development standards
       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:
         - The choice significantly impacts code quality or maintainability
         - Multiple reasonable implementations exist with different trade-offs
         - No reasonable default exists
       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**
       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: maintainability > performance > functionality
    4. Apply Developer perspective considering:
       - Implementation details and code patterns
       - Best practices and coding standards
       - Debugging strategies and edge cases
       - Performance and security considerations
       - Practical development approaches
    5. Generate development recommendations
       Each recommendation must be technically sound and practical
       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions)
    6. Define success metrics
       Create measurable, implementation-focused outcomes
       Include both quantitative metrics (performance, test coverage) and qualitative measures (code quality, maintainability)
       Each metric must be verifiable through code review or testing
    7. Return: SUCCESS (recommendations ready for implementation)

4. Write the Developer perspective to PERSONA_FILE using a development-focused structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the guidance request (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.

5. **Developer Perspective Quality Validation**: After writing the initial perspective, validate it against quality criteria:

   a. **Create Perspective Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/development-plan.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:
   
      ```markdown
      # Developer Perspective Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]
      
      **Purpose**: Validate Developer perspective completeness and quality before proceeding 
      **Created**: [DATE]
      **Feature**: [Link to Developer perspective file]

      ## Notes
      
      - Items marked incomplete require perspective updates before implementation
      ```

   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the perspective against each checklist item:
      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails
      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant perspective sections)

   c. **Handle Validation Results**:
   
      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6
   
      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:
        1. List the failing items and specific issues
        2. Update the perspective to address each issue
        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)
        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user
   
      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:
        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the perspective
        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by maintainability/performance impact) and make informed guesses for the rest
        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:

           ```markdown
           ## Question [N]: [Topic]
           
           **Context**: [Quote relevant perspective section]
           
           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]
           
           **Suggested Answers**:
           
           | Option | Answer | Technical Implications |
           |--------|--------|--------------|
           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the implementation] |
           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the implementation] |
           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the implementation] |
           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |
           
           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_
           ```

        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:
           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned
           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`
           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`
           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview
        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)
        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses
        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., "Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B")
        8. Update the perspective by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer
        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved

   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status

6. Report completion with branch name, perspective file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (implementation or next persona consultation).

**NOTE:** The script creates the persona guidance file before writing.

## Developer Persona Considerations

When providing guidance, the Developer persona will consider:

### Implementation Details
- Specific code patterns and approaches
- Framework/library integration techniques
- Error handling and edge case management
- Performance considerations at the implementation level

### Best Practices
- Clean code principles and readability
- Maintainable code organization
- Documentation and comment strategies
- Testing and validation approaches

### Practical Considerations
- Browser compatibility and progressive enhancement
- Security considerations in implementation
- Performance optimization techniques
- Memory and resource management

### Code Quality
- Refactoring opportunities and techniques
- Code review feedback and improvements
- Debugging and troubleshooting strategies
- Version control best practices

## General Guidelines

### For AI Generation

When responding to a Developer guidance request:

1. **Make informed development decisions**: Use context, coding standards, and common implementation patterns to fill gaps
2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section
3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:
   - Significantly impact code quality or maintainability
   - Have multiple reasonable implementations with different trade-offs
   - Lack any reasonable default
4. **Prioritize clarifications**: maintainability > performance > functionality
5. **Think like a senior developer**: Every vague implementation should fail the "actionable and implementable" checklist item
6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):
   - Technology constraints (when significantly impacts implementation approach)
   - Performance requirements (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)
   - Security requirements (when many possible approaches exist)

**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):
- Error handling: Standard try/catch patterns with appropriate logging
- Performance: Reasonable optimization for the given context
- Code organization: Standard patterns for the technology stack
- Testing: Unit tests covering critical functionality

### Success Metrics Guidelines

Success metrics must be:
1. **Measurable**: Include specific development metrics (performance, test coverage, code complexity)
2. **Implementation-focused**: Describe outcomes from development perspective, not system architecture
3. **Verifiable**: Can be measured through code review, testing, or performance analysis

**Good examples**:

- "Implement with <500ms response time for critical operations"
- "Achieve 80% code coverage for new functionality"
- "Follow clean code principles with <10 complexity per function"
- "Handle all edge cases with appropriate error handling"

**Bad examples** (business-focused):

- "Increase user engagement by 20%" (business outcome)
- "Capture 15% market share" (business metric)
- "Achieve 99.9% system availability" (system architecture)
- "Reduce customer acquisition cost" (business metric)
