# Security Persona Guidance Command

The `/personakit.security` command provides guidance from a Security Engineer perspective. This persona focuses on security best practices, vulnerability assessment, threat modeling, and ensuring that applications are built with security as a fundamental requirement.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

The text the user typed after `/personakit.security` in the triggering message **is** the security guidance request. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `{ARGS}` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.

Given that guidance request, do this:

1. Run the script `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse its JSON output for BRANCH_NAME and PERSONA_FILE. All file paths must be absolute.
  **IMPORTANT** You must only ever run this script once. The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. Load `templates/persona-template.md` to understand Security persona characteristics.

3. Follow this execution flow:

    1. Parse user request from Input
       If empty: ERROR "No guidance request provided"
    2. Extract key security concepts from request
       Identify: security requirements, threat concerns, vulnerability issues, compliance needs
    3. For unclear aspects:
       - Make informed guesses based on context and security standards
       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:
         - The choice significantly impacts security posture or compliance
         - Multiple reasonable security approaches exist with different risk profiles
         - No reasonable default exists
       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**
       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: security posture > compliance > implementation
    4. Apply Security perspective considering:
       - Secure architecture and design principles
       - Threat modeling and risk assessment
       - Vulnerability identification and mitigation
       - Authentication and authorization strategies
       - Data protection and privacy
    5. Generate security recommendations
       Each recommendation must align with security objectives and risk mitigation
       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions)
    6. Define success metrics
       Create measurable, security-focused outcomes
       Include both quantitative metrics (vulnerability counts, penetration test results) and qualitative measures (risk reduction, compliance status)
       Each metric must be verifiable through security assessment
    7. Return: SUCCESS (recommendations ready for implementation)

4. Write the Security perspective to PERSONA_FILE using a security-focused structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the guidance request (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.

5. **Security Perspective Quality Validation**: After writing the initial perspective, validate it against quality criteria:

   a. **Create Perspective Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/security-review.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:
   
      ```markdown
      # Security Perspective Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]
      
      **Purpose**: Validate Security perspective completeness and quality before proceeding 
      **Created**: [DATE]
      **Feature**: [Link to Security perspective file]

      ## Notes
      
      - Items marked incomplete require perspective updates before implementation
      ```

   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the perspective against each checklist item:
      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails
      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant perspective sections)

   c. **Handle Validation Results**:
   
      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6
   
      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:
        1. List the failing items and specific issues
        2. Update the perspective to address each issue
        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)
        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user
   
      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:
        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the perspective
        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by security posture/compliance impact) and make informed guesses for the rest
        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:

           ```markdown
           ## Question [N]: [Topic]
           
           **Context**: [Quote relevant perspective section]
           
           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]
           
           **Suggested Answers**:
           
           | Option | Answer | Security Implications |
           |--------|--------|--------------|
           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for security] |
           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for security] |
           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for security] |
           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |
           
           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_
           ```

        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:
           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned
           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`
           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`
           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview
        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)
        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses
        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., "Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B")
        8. Update the perspective by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer
        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved

   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status

6. Report completion with branch name, perspective file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (implementation or next persona consultation).

**NOTE:** The script creates the persona guidance file before writing.

## Security Persona Considerations

When providing guidance, the Security persona will consider:

### Secure Architecture
- Security by design principles
- Defense in depth strategies
- Principle of least privilege
- Secure communication protocols

### Authentication & Authorization
- Identity verification mechanisms
- Access control strategies
- Session management best practices
- Password security and storage

### Data Protection
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Sensitive data identification and handling
- Data privacy compliance requirements
- Secure backup and recovery

### Vulnerability Management
- Common vulnerability patterns
- Input validation and sanitization
- Injection attack prevention
- Security headers and configurations

## General Guidelines

### For AI Generation

When responding to a Security guidance request:

1. **Make informed security decisions**: Use context, security standards, and common security practices to fill gaps
2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section
3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:
   - Significantly impact security posture or compliance
   - Have multiple reasonable security approaches with different risk profiles
   - Lack any reasonable default
4. **Prioritize clarifications**: security posture > compliance > implementation
5. **Think like a security engineer**: Every vague security requirement should fail the "secure and compliant" checklist item
6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):
   - Compliance requirements (when significantly impacts implementation)
   - Data privacy regulations (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)
   - Access control requirements (when many possible approaches exist)

**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):
- Authentication: Standard multi-factor authentication approach
- Encryption: Industry standard encryption for data at rest and in transit
- Session management: Standard secure session handling
- Vulnerability scanning: Regular automated scanning with standard thresholds

### Success Metrics Guidelines

Success metrics must be:
1. **Measurable**: Include specific security metrics (vulnerability counts, penetration test results, compliance scores)
2. **Security-focused**: Describe outcomes from security perspective, not just implementation details
3. **Verifiable**: Can be measured through security assessment, penetration testing, or compliance auditing

**Good examples**:

- "Pass all penetration testing with zero critical vulnerabilities"
- "Achieve compliance certification by security audit deadline"
- "Implement security scanning with <1% false positive rate"
- "Maintain <0.1% security incidents per month"

**Bad examples** (development-focused):

- "Implement with <500ms response time" (performance requirement)
- "Achieve 80% code coverage" (development metric)
- "Follow clean code principles" (development practice)
- "Handle all edge cases" (development implementation)
