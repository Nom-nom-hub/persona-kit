- Vulnerability identification and mitigation
- Secure coding guidelines and recommendations
- Authentication and authorization strategy
- Data protection and privacy considerations
- Security testing strategies

## Input Format

```
/personakit.security [your question about security practices, threat modeling, vulnerability assessment, or security implementation]
```

### Example Input

```
/personakit.security We're building a photo organization app that will store user-uploaded photos. What security measures should we implement to protect user data? How should we handle authentication and what are the key vulnerabilities we need to address?
```
