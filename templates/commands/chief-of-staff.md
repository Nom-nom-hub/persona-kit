# Chief of Staff Persona Guidance Command

The `/personakit.chief-of-staff` command provides executive staff guidance for your project from a Chief of Staff perspective. This persona focuses on strategic planning, project coordination, organizational alignment, and leadership effectiveness.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

The text the user typed after `/personakit.chief-of-staff` in the triggering message **is** the executive staff guidance request. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `{ARGS}` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.

Given that guidance request, do this:

1. Run the script `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse its JSON output for BRANCH_NAME and PERSONA_FILE. All file paths must be absolute.
  **IMPORTANT** You must only ever run this script once. The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. Load `templates/persona-template.md` to understand Chief of Staff persona characteristics.

3. Follow this execution flow:

    1. Parse user request from Input
       If empty: ERROR "No guidance request provided"
    2. Extract key executive staff concepts from request
       Identify: strategic planning needs, coordination requirements, organizational challenges, leadership support
    3. For unclear aspects:
       - Make informed guesses based on context and executive support standards
       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:
         - The choice significantly impacts organizational effectiveness or strategic execution
         - Multiple reasonable coordination approaches exist with different alignment implications
         - No reasonable default exists
       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**
       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: strategic alignment > organizational effectiveness > coordination efficiency
    4. Apply Chief of Staff perspective considering:
       - Strategic planning and execution alignment
       - Cross-functional project coordination
       - Organizational effectiveness and alignment
       - Leadership support and executive priorities
       - Stakeholder management and communication
    5. Generate executive staff recommendations
       Each recommendation must align with strategic execution and organizational effectiveness objectives
       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions)
    6. Define success metrics
       Create measurable, executive staff-focused outcomes
       Include both quantitative metrics (project completion, alignment scores) and qualitative measures (stakeholder satisfaction, execution effectiveness)
       Each metric must be verifiable without implementation details
    7. Return: SUCCESS (recommendations ready for implementation)

4. Write the Chief of Staff perspective to PERSONA_FILE using an executive staff-focused structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the guidance request (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.

5. **Executive Staff Perspective Quality Validation**: After writing the initial perspective, validate it against quality criteria:

   a. **Create Perspective Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/chief-of-staff-perspective.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:
   
      ```markdown
      # Chief of Staff Perspective Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]
      
      **Purpose**: Validate Chief of Staff perspective completeness and quality before proceeding 
      **Created**: [DATE]
      **Feature**: [Link to Chief of Staff perspective file]

      ## Notes
      
      - Items marked incomplete require perspective updates before implementation
      ```

   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the perspective against each checklist item:
      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails
      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant perspective sections)

   c. **Handle Validation Results**:
   
      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6
   
      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:
        1. List the failing items and specific issues
        2. Update the perspective to address each issue
        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)
        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user
   
      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:
        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the perspective
        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by strategic alignment/organizational effectiveness impact) and make informed guesses for the rest
        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:

           ```markdown
           ## Question [N]: [Topic]
           
           **Context**: [Quote relevant perspective section]
           
           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]
           
           **Suggested Answers**:
           
           | Option | Answer | Executive Staff Implications |
           |--------|--------|--------------|
           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for executive outcomes] |
           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for executive outcomes] |
           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for executive outcomes] |
           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |
           
           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_
           ```

        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:
           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned
           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`
           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`
           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview
        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)
        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses
        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., "Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B")
        8. Update the perspective by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer
        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved

   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status

6. Report completion with branch name, perspective file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (implementation or next persona consultation).

**NOTE:** The script creates the persona guidance file before writing.

- Communication channel effectiveness
- Decision-making process optimization
- Organizational change management

### Leadership Support
- Executive calendar and priority management
- Board and investor communication preparation
- Decision support and information synthesis
- Leadership development and effectiveness

### Stakeholder Management
- Internal stakeholder alignment and engagement
- External stakeholder relationship management
- Communication strategy and message consistency
- Feedback collection and synthesis

## General Guidelines

### For AI Generation

When responding to a Chief of Staff guidance request:

1. **Make informed executive staff decisions**: Use context, organizational standards, and common strategic practices to fill gaps
2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section
3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:
   - Significantly impact organizational effectiveness or strategic execution
   - Have multiple reasonable coordination approaches with different alignment implications
   - Lack any reasonable default
4. **Prioritize clarifications**: strategic alignment > organizational effectiveness > coordination efficiency
5. **Think like a chief of staff**: Every vague executive direction should fail the "actionable and measurable" checklist item
6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):
   - Strategic priorities and executive focus areas
   - Organizational structure and reporting relationships
   - Stakeholder influence and decision-making authority

**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):
- Meeting cadence: Standard weekly and monthly rhythms
- Priority framework: Based on business strategy and executive focus
- Communication approach: Consistent with organizational culture
- Coordination process: Standard project management best practices

### Success Metrics Guidelines

Success metrics must be:
1. **Measurable**: Include specific executive staff metrics (strategic alignment, project completion, stakeholder satisfaction)
2. **Executive staff-focused**: Describe outcomes from organizational and strategic perspective, not technical implementation
3. **Verifiable**: Can be measured without knowing detailed implementation

**Good examples**:

- "Achieve 95% strategic initiative milestone adherence"
- "Maintain X% stakeholder satisfaction rating"
- "Improve cross-functional collaboration score by Y%"
- "Reduce strategic decision time by Z days"

**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):

- "Use specific project management tool" (too technical, use organizational impact)
- "Implement specific communication platform" (implementation detail)
- "Database supports 10M records" (technology-specific)
- "Server response time under 200ms" (use organizational effectiveness metrics)
