# Persona Kit Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for **Persona Kit** - a toolkit for persona-driven development workflows and AI agent management.

## 🎭 What is Persona Kit?

Persona Kit is a comprehensive toolkit designed for **persona-driven development** - an approach that leverages AI personas to enhance software development workflows, improve decision-making, and maintain consistency across projects.

Unlike traditional development approaches, Persona Kit allows you to:

- **Define specialized AI personas** for different roles (architect, developer, tester, product manager, etc.)
- **Create reusable interaction patterns** that maintain consistency across development sessions
- **Establish structured workflows** that guide development processes
- **Maintain shared knowledge bases** that evolve with your project
- **Generate templates** for common development tasks and documentation

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🎭 Persona System
- **Role-based personas** with specialized knowledge and behaviors
- **Context-aware interactions** that adapt to project needs
- **Persona memory** that accumulates project-specific knowledge
- **Persona switching** for multi-role development scenarios

### 🔄 Workflow Management
- **Structured development workflows** with clear phases
- **Template-based task generation** for consistency
- **Progress tracking** and state management
- **Integration with popular development tools**

### 📚 Knowledge Management
- **Shared memory system** for project context
- **Pattern libraries** for common development scenarios
- **Template repositories** for documentation and code
- **Historical context** preservation

### ⚙️ Developer Experience
- **Python-based CLI** for easy integration
- **Rich configuration system** for customization
- **Extensive documentation** and examples
- **Cross-platform compatibility**

## 🎯 The 5-Step Workflow

Persona Kit introduces a structured 5-step workflow for effective development:

1. **📋 Constitution** - Define project principles and values
2. **🎭 Personas** - Create specialized AI roles and behaviors
3. **🔄 Patterns** - Establish reusable interaction patterns
4. **⚡ Workflows** - Define structured development processes
5. **🚀 Implement** - Execute with consistency and quality

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd persona-kit

# Install dependencies
uv pip install -e .
```

### 2. Initialize a Project

```bash
# Initialize persona-kit in your project
persona-kit init

# Or initialize in current directory
persona-kit init --here
```

### 3. Create Your First Persona

```bash
# Create a development persona
persona-kit persona create "Senior Python Developer" --role developer --expertise python,architecture,testing
```

### 4. Set Up a Workflow

```bash
# Create a standard development workflow
persona-kit workflow create "feature-development" --template feature
```

## 🌟 Philosophy

Persona-driven development represents a paradigm shift from traditional development approaches:

- **From**: Generic AI assistants that adapt to every situation
- **To**: Specialized personas that excel in specific domains

- **From**: Ad-hoc development processes
- **To**: Structured, repeatable workflows

- **From**: Isolated development sessions
- **To**: Persistent knowledge and context
