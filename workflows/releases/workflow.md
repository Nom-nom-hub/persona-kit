# Release Workflow

## Workflow Overview and Purpose

This workflow provides a structured approach for planning, coordinating, and executing software releases across environments. It ensures safe, predictable deployments while minimizing risk and maintaining quality standards throughout the release process.

## Trigger Conditions and Entry Points

**Primary Triggers**:

- Completion of feature development and testing
- Critical bug fixes requiring immediate deployment
- Security patches or compliance requirements
- Performance improvements or infrastructure updates
- Market-driven releases or product launches

**Release Types**:
- **Major Releases**: Significant new features, breaking changes
- **Minor Releases**: New features, backward-compatible changes
- **Patch Releases**: Bug fixes, security updates, hotfixes
- **Emergency Releases**: Critical issues requiring immediate attention

5. **User Acceptance Testing** (Stakeholder, Product Manager)
   - Demonstrate new features and functionality
   - Validate business requirements and workflows
   - Confirm user experience meets expectations
   - Obtain formal approval for release

6. **Production Readiness Review** (Product Manager, Developer, DevOps)
   - Assess overall system health and performance
   - Review monitoring and alerting configurations
   - Validate backup and disaster recovery procedures
   - Confirm rollback capabilities and procedures

### Phase 3: Release Execution (2-8 hours)

7. **Pre-Deployment Steps** (DevOps, Developer)
   - Create release branch and deployment package
   - Execute pre-deployment health checks
   - Notify stakeholders of deployment start
   - Prepare communication channels for updates

8. **Staged Deployment** (DevOps)
   - Deploy to staging environment for final validation
   - Execute smoke tests and integration checks
   - Validate database migrations and data integrity
   - Confirm all services start correctly

9. **Production Deployment** (DevOps)
   - Execute deployment to production environment
   - Monitor system health and performance metrics
   - Validate core functionality and user workflows
   - Watch for errors and abnormal behavior

### Phase 4: Post-Release Activities (1-7 days)

10. **Immediate Monitoring** (DevOps, Developer)
    - Monitor system performance and error rates
    - Track user engagement and feature adoption
    - Watch for any immediate issues or regressions
    - Maintain communication with incident response team

11. **Issue Resolution** (Developer, QA Engineer)
    - Address any post-deployment issues promptly
    - Implement hotfixes if critical issues arise
    - Communicate status updates to stakeholders
    - Document any unexpected behaviors or edge cases

12. **Release Validation** (Product Manager, QA Engineer)
    - Verify all planned features work as expected
    - Confirm performance meets established benchmarks
    - Validate user experience and accessibility
    - Collect initial user feedback and satisfaction data

## Required Inputs and Outputs

**Required Inputs**:
