# Bug Fix Workflow

## Workflow Overview and Purpose

This workflow provides a systematic approach for identifying, investigating, resolving, and preventing software bugs and issues. It ensures rapid response to production issues while maintaining quality standards and preventing regression through thorough root cause analysis and testing.

## Trigger Conditions and Entry Points

**Primary Triggers**:
- Production system errors or failures
- User-reported issues through support channels
- Automated monitoring alerts and thresholds
- Failed automated tests or deployment pipelines
- Security vulnerability reports
- Performance degradation or system slowdown

**Severity-Based Entry Points**:
- **Critical**: Immediate response required, affects core functionality
- **High**: Significant user impact, workaround available
- **Medium**: Noticeable issues, doesn't block core workflows
- **Low**: Minor issues, cosmetic or edge case problems

## Step-by-Step Process with Role Assignments

### Phase 1: Triage & Assessment (15 minutes - 2 hours)

1. **Issue Detection** (Monitoring Systems, Users, QA Engineer)
   - Capture error details, stack traces, and environment information
   - Reproduce issue in development or staging environment
   - Assess initial scope and potential impact
   - Create structured issue report with all relevant details

2. **Severity Classification** (Product Manager, Developer, QA Engineer)
   - Evaluate business and user impact of the issue
   - Assess system stability and data integrity risks
   - Determine urgency level and response timeline
   - Assign appropriate priority and escalation level

3. **Initial Investigation** (Developer, QA Engineer)
   - Review code in affected areas for obvious issues
   - Check recent changes and deployments
   - Analyze logs and error patterns
   - Identify potential root causes and quick fixes

### Phase 2: Investigation & Resolution (2 hours - 3 days)

4. **Deep Dive Analysis** (Developer)
   - Reproduce issue consistently in controlled environment
   - Analyze code paths and data flow leading to issue
   - Review related components and dependencies
   - Identify root cause through systematic debugging

5. **Solution Development** (Developer)
   - Design appropriate fix addressing root cause
   - Implement solution with minimal side effects
   - Add additional logging or monitoring as needed
   - Create unit tests to prevent regression

6. **Code Review & Validation** (Developer, QA Engineer)
   - Submit fix for peer review and feedback
   - Validate fix addresses original issue
   - Ensure no unintended side effects introduced
   - Confirm test coverage for the fix

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality Assurance (1-8 hours)

7. **Comprehensive Testing** (QA Engineer, Developer)
   - Execute full regression test suite
   - Test edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Validate fix across different environments
   - Perform load and performance testing if applicable

8. **Stakeholder Validation** (Product Manager, Stakeholder)
   - Demonstrate fix to affected stakeholders
   - Confirm issue resolution meets expectations
   - Validate no negative impact on user experience
   - Obtain approval for deployment

### Phase 4: Deployment & Monitoring (30 minutes - 4 hours)

9. **Pre-Deployment Preparation** (Developer, DevOps)
   - Prepare deployment package and rollback plan
   - Schedule deployment window with minimal impact
   - Notify stakeholders of upcoming fix deployment
   - Set up enhanced monitoring for post-deployment

10. **Deployment Execution** (DevOps, Developer)
    - Deploy fix to staging environment for validation
    - Execute smoke tests and integration checks
    - Deploy to production environment
    - Monitor initial system behavior and error rates

11. **Post-Deployment Monitoring** (QA Engineer, Developer, Product Manager)
    - Monitor system metrics and error rates
    - Verify issue resolution in production environment
    - Watch for any unintended side effects
    - Collect user feedback and system performance data

## Required Inputs and Outputs

**Required Inputs**:
- Detailed bug report with reproduction steps
- Environment information and system logs
- User impact assessment and urgency level
- Recent code changes and deployment history
- Expected behavior and acceptance criteria

**Key Outputs**:
- Root cause analysis and fix implementation
- Updated code with regression prevention
- Test cases covering the bug scenario
- Deployment documentation and rollback procedures
- Post-mortem analysis and prevention recommendations

## Success Criteria and Exit Conditions

**Success Criteria**:
- Bug completely resolved with no remaining symptoms
- Root cause identified and addressed
- No regression in existing functionality
- Comprehensive test coverage for the fix
- Stakeholder confirmation of issue resolution

**Exit Conditions**:
- Fix deployed to production environment
- Post-deployment monitoring period completed
- All related issues and side effects resolved
- Documentation updated with lessons learned
- Prevention measures implemented

## Integration Points with Patterns and Personas

**Pattern Integration**:
- [[../patterns/feedback-loops/implementation-review|Implementation Review Pattern]] - For post-deployment validation
- [[../patterns/communication/structured-update|Structured Update Pattern]] - For incident communication
- [[../patterns/conflict-resolution/structured-dialogue|Structured Dialogue Pattern]] - For cross-team issue resolution
- [[../patterns/decision-making/risk-assessment|Risk Assessment Pattern]] - For evaluating fix impact

**Persona Collaboration**:
- **Developer**: Investigates root cause, implements fixes, ensures code quality
- **QA Engineer**: Reproduces issues, validates fixes, ensures comprehensive testing
- **Product Manager**: Assesses business impact, prioritizes fixes, communicates with stakeholders
- **Stakeholder**: Reports issues, validates resolutions, provides business context
