# Feature Development Workflow

## Workflow Overview and Purpose

This workflow provides a comprehensive framework for developing new features from conception through deployment. It ensures systematic progression through discovery, design, implementation, testing, and release phases while maintaining quality standards and stakeholder alignment.

## Trigger Conditions and Entry Points

**Primary Triggers**:
- New feature request from product roadmap
- User story identified during backlog refinement
- Market opportunity or competitive response requirement
- Technical improvement or modernization initiative
- Customer request or feedback-driven enhancement

**Entry Points**:
- Sprint planning session with prioritized backlog
- Product manager feature specification
- Stakeholder feature request with business justification
- Technical debt remediation identified in retrospective

## Step-by-Step Process with Role Assignments

### Phase 1: Discovery & Planning (2-5 days)

1. **Feature Scoping** (Product Manager, Stakeholder)

   - Create feature brief with acceptance criteria

2. **Technical Analysis** (Developer, Product Manager)
   - Assess technical feasibility and complexity
   - Identify dependencies and integration points
   - Estimate development effort and timeline
   - Evaluate architectural impact and constraints

3. **Design Collaboration** (Designer, Product Manager, Developer)
   - Create user experience wireframes and mockups
   - Define interaction patterns and user flows
   - Review design feasibility with development team
   - Iterate based on technical and business feedback

### Phase 2: Implementation (5-15 days)

4. **Development Setup** (Developer)
   - Set up feature branch and development environment
   - Configure necessary tooling and dependencies
   - Create implementation plan with milestones
   - Set up monitoring and logging frameworks

5. **Core Implementation** (Developer)
   - Implement core functionality following design specifications
   - Write unit tests and integration tests
   - Implement error handling and edge cases
   - Maintain code quality standards and documentation

6. **Design Implementation** (Developer, Designer)
   - Implement user interface components and styling
   - Ensure responsive design and accessibility compliance
   - Integrate design system components and patterns
   - Conduct design quality reviews

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance (3-7 days)

7. **Testing Preparation** (QA Engineer, Developer)
   - Create comprehensive test plan and test cases
   - Set up test data and testing environments
   - Configure automated testing pipelines
   - Define quality gates and acceptance criteria

8. **Quality Execution** (QA Engineer)
   - Execute functional, integration, and regression tests
   - Conduct usability and accessibility testing
   - Perform cross-browser and device compatibility testing
   - Validate performance and security requirements

9. **Bug Resolution** (Developer, QA Engineer)
   - Triage and prioritize identified issues
   - Implement fixes for critical and major bugs
   - Re-test resolved issues and edge cases
   - Update test cases based on findings

### Phase 4: Deployment & Release (1-3 days)

10. **Pre-Deployment Review** (Product Manager, Developer, QA Engineer)
    - Conduct final quality and readiness assessment
    - Review deployment checklist and rollback plan
    - Validate monitoring and alerting setup
    - Confirm stakeholder communication plan

11. **Deployment Execution** (Developer, DevOps)
    - Execute deployment to staging environment
    - Conduct final integration and smoke tests
    - Deploy to production environment
    - Monitor initial performance and error rates

12. **Post-Deployment Validation** (QA Engineer, Product Manager)
    - Verify feature functionality in production
    - Monitor user feedback and system metrics
    - Address any immediate post-deployment issues
    - Document lessons learned and improvements

## Required Inputs and Outputs

**Required Inputs**:
- Feature specification with clear requirements
- Design mockups and user experience guidelines
- Technical constraints and architectural decisions
- Success metrics and acceptance criteria
- Stakeholder priorities and business context

**Key Outputs**:
- Implemented feature meeting all acceptance criteria
- Comprehensive test coverage and documentation
- Deployment artifacts and runbooks
- User documentation and release notes
- Performance metrics and monitoring dashboards

## Success Criteria and Exit Conditions

**Success Criteria**:
- Feature meets all defined acceptance criteria
- Quality gates pass (test coverage, performance, security)
- Stakeholder approval and user satisfaction
- Successful deployment with zero critical incidents
- Documentation completed and accessible

**Exit Conditions**:
- All phases completed successfully
- Feature deployed to production environment
- Post-deployment validation completed
- Stakeholder sign-off received
- Lessons learned documented

## Integration Points with Patterns and Personas

**Pattern Integration**:
- [[../patterns/decision-making/feature-prioritization|Feature Prioritization Pattern]] - For initial feature selection
- [[../patterns/communication/structured-update|Structured Update Pattern]] - For progress communication
- [[../patterns/feedback-loops/implementation-review|Implementation Review Pattern]] - For quality validation
- [[../patterns/conflict-resolution/interest-based-negotiation|Interest-Based Negotiation Pattern]] - For resolving design conflicts

**Persona Collaboration**:
- **Product Manager**: Drives feature vision, defines requirements, manages stakeholder expectations
- **Developer**: Implements technical solution, ensures code quality, troubleshoots issues
- **Designer**: Creates user experience, validates usability, ensures design consistency
- **QA Engineer**: Validates quality, identifies defects, ensures test coverage
- **Stakeholder**: Provides business context, validates outcomes, approves direction

## Common Variations and Adaptations

### Hotfix Feature Development
