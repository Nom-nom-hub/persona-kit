   - Review technical feasibility considerations
   - Assess alignment with business objectives

6. **Cross-Functional Discussion** (Product Manager, Developer, QA Engineer, Stakeholder)
   - Address technical implementation challenges
   - Discuss user experience and accessibility requirements
   - Review performance and scalability implications
   - Align on success metrics and validation criteria

### Phase 3: Synthesis & Decision Making (2-4 hours)

7. **Feedback Analysis** (Designer, Product Manager)
   - Categorize and prioritize feedback items
   - Identify patterns and common themes
   - Assess feasibility of requested changes
   - Document design constraints and limitations

8. **Design Iteration Planning** (Designer)
   - Create prioritized list of design improvements
   - Estimate effort for proposed changes
   - Plan iteration timeline and milestones
   - Identify quick wins vs. major redesigns

9. **Decision Documentation** (Product Manager, Designer)
   - Document agreed-upon design decisions
   - Capture rationale for accepted changes
   - Note rejected feedback with clear reasoning
   - Establish next steps and action items

### Phase 4: Implementation & Validation (1-5 days)

10. **Design Refinement** (Designer)
    - Implement approved design changes
    - Update specifications and documentation
    - Create detailed implementation guidelines
    - Prepare assets for development handoff

11. **Developer Handoff** (Designer, Developer)
    - Review technical implementation approach
    - Clarify design requirements and constraints
    - Discuss responsive and accessibility implementations
    - Establish ongoing collaboration process

12. **Quality Validation** (QA Engineer, Designer)
    - Review implementation against design specifications
    - Validate accessibility and usability compliance
    - Test responsive behavior across devices
    - Confirm design system consistency
