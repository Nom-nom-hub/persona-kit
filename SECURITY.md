## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Persona Kit, please report it responsibly using one of the following methods:

### GitHub Private Security Reporting
Use GitHub's private security reporting feature to report vulnerabilities directly:
1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/github/persona-kit/security) of the repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the details of the vulnerability in the provided form

### Email
Alternatively, you can email the maintainers directly at [security@github.com](mailto:security@github.com).

### What to Include in Your Report
When reporting a security issue, please include the following information:
- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any potential mitigations you've identified
- Your contact information for follow-up questions

## Response Timeline
- We will acknowledge your report within 72 hours
- We will investigate and provide an initial response within 1 week
- Updates on the status of your report will be provided every 2 weeks

## Security Best Practices
When working with Persona Kit, we recommend following these security best practices:

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update your local development environment and dependencies
2. **Review AI Agent Security**: Be aware that AI agents may store credentials or tokens in project-specific directories (e.g., `.claude`, `.gemini`, etc.)
3. **Protect Sensitive Information**: Be mindful of what information you share with AI agents during development
4. **Use Secure Networks**: When possible, use secure networks when communicating with AI services
5. **Review Generated Code**: Always review code generated by AI agents before integrating into your project

## Known Security Considerations
- Persona Kit projects may contain agent-specific directories (e.g., `.claude`, `.gemini`) that can store authentication tokens - consider adding these to `.gitignore`
- The tool facilitates communication with external AI services, so network traffic will be generated
- Always verify that AI-generated code follows your organization's security standards

## Supported Versions
We provide security updates for the following versions:
- Latest release (recommended)
- Previous minor release (security fixes only)

We strongly encourage users to keep their Persona Kit installation up-to-date with the latest release.

## Disclosure Policy
- We will coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline
- We will credit reporters in our release notes (unless anonymity is requested)
- We will provide a timeline for fixes and updates as appropriate
