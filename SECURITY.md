## 🔍 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### How to Report

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities using one of these methods:

1. **GitHub Private Report** (Recommended): Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature in the [Persona Kit repository](https://github.com/persona-kit/persona-kit/security/advisories)
2. **Private Email**: Contact the security team for sensitive reports

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Environment**: OS, Python version, dependencies
- **Proof of Concept**: If possible, include a minimal PoC
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have suggestions for fixing the issue

### Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We follow a **responsible disclosure** policy:

1. **Initial Response**: We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: We will investigate the report within 1 week
3. **Fix Development**: We will develop and test a fix
4. **Coordinated Release**: We will coordinate the release with you
5. **Public Disclosure**: We will publicly disclose the vulnerability after the fix is available
